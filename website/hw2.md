# Homework 2 - A Spatial SIR model

Final homework about epidemic modelling! This time we take it into the spatial domain: 

> In order to get infected, you need to **meet** an infected person!

We apply the same simple ideas of transmission and recovery, but add this feature. We also use our new type-creating superpowers!

## Advance Warning

* You must verify that
    1. your user has read/write access in the julia `DEPOT` directory. type `DEPOT_PATH` on your julia console to find out (you care about the first entry of that vector).
    2. You are running at least Pluto version `v0.12.20`. If not, in your global environment, type `up Pluto`.
* Please be patient while the notebook starts up. Have an eye on your console where you can see what `worker i` is up to. 

## Notebooks

Get the notebook here as usual. [right click and save this notebook, or copy the link directly into a running Pluto session to open!](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/blob/master/homework/homework2/epidemic.jl)


## Homework Submission

You need to submit by Thursday evening before the next class on Friday. 

**How and What to Submit?**

* What? your Pluto notebook (that's a simple `.jl` file for the notebook)
* How?
    * SciencesPo Students: please use the dedicated hand-in facility on moodle
    * Other Institutions: please send me a private message on slack with your files attached. _For non sciencespo students, please stick to the convention of naming your .jl files like `lastname_firstname_HWx.jl` for homework `x` - thanks!_
