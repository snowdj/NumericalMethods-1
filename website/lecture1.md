## Prerequisites: Installing the software environment

Check out the [installation](/installation/) page on this website which was copied from the MIT course *Computational Thinking*, or just watch the following video to learn how to set up Julia and Pluto -- two pieces of software you will need to run the course materials on your own computer.

## Introduction and: Why Julia?

In this section we want to understand why julia is a good choice for computational tasks - for Economists and others.

## So, Julia is *Fast*?

We will dive right in with a fun benchmarking exercise where we compare julia to other commonly used languages.

## Basics of Arrays in Julia

Arrays are very important in computational work. Here we have a notebook:

## Introduction to SIR Epidemiologic Modelling

We can't have a computational course in 2021 *without* talking about epidemiological models! So we'll present the workhorse model in this week's notebooks as well.
